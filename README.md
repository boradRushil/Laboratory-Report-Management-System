#  Laboratory-Report-Management-System

**A Blockchain based system for sharing of patients medical reports.** 

*The project aimed to resolve the problem of laboratory records data theft containing sensitive patient information with the use of blockchain's immutability.*

### Problem Statement:
There is an increase in the forging of medical reports and data leaks by third-party intervention. This encourages falsifying claims, failure to maintain proper medical records, waiving cost-shares, improper billing practices, and other healthcare frauds. 
Also, the data & its privacy is not secured between the patient and the respective doctors across the hospitals in India which leads to many healthcare abuses.
